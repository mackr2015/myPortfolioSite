As a Full Stack Developer, I sometimes assume that those I'm speaking with have the same level of technical understanding, which can create a disconnect.

To address this, I’ve actively worked on improving my communication skills. I’ve been engaging in more open discussions with friends and colleagues who are curious about my work, which has helped me explain technical concepts in simpler terms. During these conversations, I make a point to pause and ask if they’re following along, ensuring that I’m communicating effectively and that the message is clear.</textarea>
